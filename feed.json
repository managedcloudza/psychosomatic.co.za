Because conscious is fear, thoughts must be lies so therefore, there is actually no war within you.</p>\n<p>There is only giving your conscience the visibility of speaking it's/your truth whilst you listen consciousl.</p>\n<p>So, the only way to your inner peace is to accept your life for what it is, with everything that surrounds it, for everything that is in it and for everything that it is, both wonderful and horrible, both nutruring and terrifying. Just as it it </p>\n<p>And then, only when you separate life's unevadable events from your own power and capacity to choose your a positive experience of each and every event thus taking life's tests and learning life's lessons, will you truly be free to live your truth, no matter what is is which makes you happy  </p>\n<p>For herein lies faith which is not weakened by a question nor strengthened by an answer</p>\n<p>Faith starts with your very own ray of conscience truth emanating from the power of your own sun.</p>",

Although we are all born with a specific nature formed by our genetic code and infused with our own signature Psychoneuro-emotional design, there are aspects about our perceptions and behaviour that we can adjust. Life hits us all at some or other point, but we must and can choose to think and behave in a manner which is conducive both towards our own mental health and towards our \"personal brand\", the way in which we are perceived.</p>\n<p>Yes, our personalities are either categorized as sociophillic or sociophobic, attractive or repulsive. Yes, our characters are formed by the value systems which we adopt as a result of our attractions to and repulsions of behavioural patters in society and specifically, behaviour within our social circles.</p>\n<p>So before we can attract the best, albeit a friend or partner, we first need to become the best version of ourselves. </p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://www.psychosomatic.co.za\">www.psychosomatic.co.za</a> and learn how to fall in love again..with yourself!</p>\n<p> </p>",

Our minds create a possible, perhaps even probable, but nonetheless non-existent outcome of what is occuring in the present. This habitual pattern of thought alignes with related emotions precipitating a physiological response of fight, flight or freeze syndrome.</p>\n<p>The repetitive secretion of \"unnecessary\" secretion of fight, flight or freeze syndrome causes the panic chemistry to reach an unjustified high, thus, in turn, stressing out mind and body.</p>\n<p>If the worst does actually occur, you will be so busy coping with the reality of its occurence that you wont need to stress about it occuring, because it's just occured.</p>\n<p>So, don't worry about what if, worry about what is.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>There is a distinct difference between incident occurence in our lives and how we recall those incidents occuring. Our emotional state at the time of incident plays a large part in our choice, albeit subconscious, of how we remember incidents and occurences. Emotions can change towards \" what happened\" for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>Our conscious recollective memoric area of brain can only recall events with lucid clarity for a relatively compromised period of time. The selected emotion affiliated with an incident, perceived as either positive or negative, can also influence our \"elected\" recollection. Personality types too play a role specifically relative to incidents precipitating fight, flight or freeze responses.</p>\n<p>Bottom line; The event which actually occured is vastly different in reality to our experiential response thereunto.</p>\n<p>This is what makes my practice, Psycho-Somatic so profound. Using a unique method of separating event from experience of event allows you to recognize events, specifically those that have bothered you, and replace your historic perception of the past with a new, healthy productive memory.</p>\n<p>This by no means implies that we remove or alter the past, we simply re-create the way YOU CHOOSE to revisit the past.</p>\n<p>BINGO! New perspective on the past, new lease on the future. </p>",
