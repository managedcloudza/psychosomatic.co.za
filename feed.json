            "content_html": "<p>\"Fear is a projected emotion based on what may be, not what is.\" Dr J S Greenstein.</p>\n<p>Constant mental reiteration of impending doom and gloom causes us to exist in preperation for the worst, even though the worst has not necessarily occured. Our minds create a possible, perhaps even probable, but nonetheless non-existent outcome of what is occuring in the present. This habitual pattern of thought alignes with related emotions precipitating a physiological response of fight, flight or freeze syndrome.</p>\n<p>The repetitive secretion of \"unnecessary\" secretion of fight, flight or freeze syndrome causes the panic chemistry to reach an unjustified high, thus, in turn, stressing out mind and body.</p>\n<p>If the worst does actually occur, you will be so busy coping with the reality of its occurence that you wont need to stress about it occuring, because it's just occured.</p>\n<p>So, don't worry about what if, worry about what is.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>There is a distinct difference between incident occurence in our lives and how we recall those incidents occuring. Our emotional state at the time of incident plays a large part in our choice, albeit subconscious, of how we remember incidents and occurences. Emotions can change towards \" what happened\" for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>Our conscious recollective memoric area of brain can only recall events with lucid clarity for a relatively compromised period of time. The selected emotion affiliated with an incident, perceived as either positive or negative, can also influence our \"elected\" recollection. Personality types too play a role specifically relative to incidents precipitating fight, flight or freeze responses.</p>\n<p>Bottom line; The event which actually occured is vastly different in reality to our experiential response thereunto.</p>\n<p>This is what makes my practice, Psycho-Somatic so profound. Using a unique method of separating event from experience of event allows you to recognize events, specifically those that have bothered you, and replace your historic perception of the past with a new, healthy productive memory.</p>\n<p>This by no means implies that we remove or alter the past, we simply re-create the way YOU CHOOSE to revisit the past.</p>\n<p>BINGO! New perspective on the past, new lease on the future. </p>",
