                <p>You are at war within yourself because you are not living your truth. The war is between your conscience and your conscious. The feelings of the conscience speak the power of  truth Whilst the thoughts of the conscious speak the fear of truth's power.</p>
<p>You are at war within yourself, or so you think. Because conscious is fear, thoughts must be lies so therefore, there is actually no war within you.</p>
<p>There is only giving your conscience the visibility of speaking it's/your truth whilst you listen consciousl.</p>
<p>So, the only way to your inner peace is to accept your life for what it is, with everything that surrounds it, for everything that is in it and for everything that it is, both wonderful and horrible, both nutruring and terrifying. Just as it it </p>
<p>And then, only when you separate life's unevadable events from your own power and capacity to choose your a positive experience of each and every event thus taking life's tests and learning life's lessons, will you truly be free to live your truth, no matter what is is which makes you happy  </p>
<p>For herein lies faith which is not weakened by a question nor strengthened by an answer</p>
<p>Faith starts with your very own ray of conscience truth emanating from the power of your own sun.</p>

                <p>The conscience is the inner voice within each and every sane mind. It is the voice that can only speak the truth. It speaks to us when we are fighting our instinct to do what is good for ourselves and for others. It is the voice of reckoning. It is the voice which shows us the light in our own self-created minds of dark chaos and self-doubt</p>
<p>Listen to your inner voice of conscience for it will not and cannot be silent until you do. It is here to provide the lessons and tests of our own truth and until we learn from it, it will not be silenced.</p>

                <p>Would you date yourself? Gender aside, I'm talking about personality, character and value systems. Although we are all born with a specific nature formed by our genetic code and infused with our own signature Psychoneuro-emotional design, there are aspects about our perceptions and behaviour that we can adjust. Life hits us all at some or other point, but we must and can choose to think and behave in a manner which is conducive both towards our own mental health and towards our "personal brand", the way in which we are perceived.</p>
<p>Yes, our personalities are either categorized as sociophillic or sociophobic, attractive or repulsive. Yes, our characters are formed by the value systems which we adopt as a result of our attractions to and repulsions of behavioural patters in society and specifically, behaviour within our social circles.</p>
<p>So before we can attract the best, albeit a friend or partner, we first need to become the best version of ourselves. </p>

<p>We do, however have total, or almost total control over how we respond to life's happenings.</p>
<p>I have named this Psychological equation E³; Event + Experience = Eventuality.</p>
<p>In other words, events happen but how we choose to experience those events determines, NOT essentially the outcome of the event, but moreso how we have CHOSEN to process the reality of the event.</p>

                <p>"Fear is a projected emotion based on what may be, not what is." Dr J S Greenstein.</p>
<p>Constant mental reiteration of impending doom and gloom causes us to exist in preperation for the worst, even though the worst has not necessarily occured. Our minds create a possible, perhaps even probable, but nonetheless non-existent outcome of what is occuring in the present. This habitual pattern of thought alignes with related emotions precipitating a physiological response of fight, flight or freeze syndrome.</p>
<p>The repetitive secretion of "unnecessary" secretion of fight, flight or freeze syndrome causes the panic chemistry to reach an unjustified high, thus, in turn, stressing out mind and body.</p>
<p>If the worst does actually occur, you will be so busy coping with the reality of its occurence that you wont need to stress about it occuring, because it's just occured.</p>
<p>So, don't worry about what if, worry about what is.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>There is a distinct difference between incident occurence in our lives and how we recall those incidents occuring. Our emotional state at the time of incident plays a large part in our choice, albeit subconscious, of how we remember incidents and occurences. Emotions can change towards " what happened" for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Our conscious recollective memoric area of brain can only recall events with lucid clarity for a relatively compromised period of time. The selected emotion affiliated with an incident, perceived as either positive or negative, can also influence our "elected" recollection. Personality types too play a role specifically relative to incidents precipitating fight, flight or freeze responses.</p>
<p>Bottom line; The event which actually occured is vastly different in reality to our experiential response thereunto.</p>
<p>This is what makes my practice, Psycho-Somatic so profound. Using a unique method of separating event from experience of event allows you to recognize events, specifically those that have bothered you, and replace your historic perception of the past with a new, healthy productive memory.</p>
<p>This by no means implies that we remove or alter the past, we simply re-create the way YOU CHOOSE to revisit the past.</p>
<p>BINGO! New perspective on the past, new lease on the future. </p>

                <p>It's easy to be ugly when you're insecure, feel threatened and lack confidence. I'ts easy to be ugly when others are succeeding and you're not. It's easy to be ugly when others are living their truth and you're not. It's easy to be ugly when even a poor person seems happy enough. It's easy to be ugly when you feel victimised by life. It's easy to be ugly when the world, in its chaotic state, rips other people to spiritual pieces. It's easu to be ugly when people who are different from the "norm" in terms of colour, creet and gender identification. It's easy to climb on the ugly band wagon and join in the humuliation of innocent people who mean no harm and whose only "sin" is just trying to live in peace albeit with a skew face, a damaged physique, a toothless mouth and an old car.</p>
<p>Live YOUR truth. Rock YOUR truth. Let all others who do no harm live theirs.</p>

<p>You'de be able to wake up in the morning, press a button on your cranial tracker and download your dreams to a pod which connects to your computer or TV seemlessly, allowing you to replay your dreams with the exactness in every detail as to how they occured in your sleep prior.</p>
<p>Ahead of its time?!..Perhaps, but one thing's for certain..Our dream material is useful in determining our underlying emotions and states of mind.</p>
