                <p>The voice of your conscience is what your inner truth sounds like. it tells you who you are, what you should do, how you should live, how you should love. It is the voice that raises red flags, the voice that notifies you of stop streets. This voice is called intuition. It sets the parameter between feeling and thinking. It is your sensible instinct.</p>
<p>The more you listen to this vital voice, the less it speaks. </p>
<p>Minimize your ego and maximize your sense.</p>

                <p>I've had a vision for some time now. Can you imagine a customised non-contact device that tracks your dream activity construct across the four areas of your brain associated thereunto, irrespective of the numerous positions that your head and body assumes during sleep?! </p>
<p>You'de be able to wake up in the morning, press a button on your cranial tracker and download your dreams to a pod which connects to your computer or TV seemlessly, allowing you to replay your dreams with the exactness in every detail as to how they occured in your sleep prior.</p>
<p>Ahead of its time?!..Perhaps, but one thing's for certain..Our dream material is useful in determining our underlying emotions and states of mind.</p>
<p>In the meantime, my practice has some amazing solutions to a host of diverse challenges which you may be experiencing.</p>
